# R is a great tool for data analysis!

Why to use R for data analysis / data science:

- Reproducibility

- Quality (>10k packages)

- Flexibility

- Community

# Ways of sharing your results:

--
- Reports for your boss/client/teacher/colleagues
- Presentations for your boss/clients/teacher/colleagues
- Articles (Academic journals, press, blog posts)
- Books, Thesis
- Others


---
# Software for writing

--
- Most of us started and still use Word processors (Ms Word, Libreoffice, )
  - Formatted text ![](img/word.jpg)

--
- LaTeX is very popular in some areas (Mostly academia)
  - Plain text with markup tagging (i.e. \textbf{Bold text})

--
- Markdown (increasing popularity)
  - Plain text with lightweight markup tagging (i.e. `**text**`)

--
- Markdown flavours 
  - i.e. Pandoc for extended features such as tables, figures, quotes

--

> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. – John Gruber

---
# But why?

- A markdown file is a plain text file. No format issues/license issues/software version/software availability issues.

- Since is text file, you can use version control (git/subversion), or other diff/merge tools (meld,...)

- Exportability. The same file can easily be converted to word/pdf/html or even a presentation.

---
# Comparison with other systems

--
- RMarkdown vs MS Word or MS Powerpoint.

--
- RMarkdown vs $\LaTeX$

--
- RStudio vs Texmaker, TexnicCenter, TexStudio,... 
  - Pro tip; use "infinite moon reader" for automatic display of HTML.

--
- RStudio vs Overleaf, Authorea.
  - Pro tip: Use github.com

# The R flavoured Markdown

- R Markdown uses Pandoc
- Integrated with RStudio
- Integrated with R 
- Same notation, different outputs: .html, .docx, .pdf, .odt, etc. 

---
# Rmarkdown notation

You can use inline format for text:

- Italic with `_text_` or `*text*`: *Italic text*
- Bold with `**text**`: **Bold text**
- Hyperlinks with `[text](link)`, e.g., [cdv](https://cdv.pl/).
- Images with `![Alternative text](Path/to/image)`

![cdv](img/davinci.png).

# Rmarkdown notation

- Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs, e.g.,

```markdown
# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header
```
# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header

---
# Lists 

Unordered list items start with `*`, `-`, or `+`, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list, e.g.,

```markdown
- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item
```

The output is:

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item

---
# Lists 

Ordered list items start with numbers (you can also nest lists within lists), e.g.,

```markdown
1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item
```

The output does not look too much different with the Markdown source:

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item
    
---
# Quotes 

Blockquotes are written after `>`, e.g.,

```markdown
> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, 
> I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand 
> and lead him to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain
```

> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain

# Formulas

- Equations can be written using LaTeX notation 
- Inline equations should be enclosed into dollar signs:
  - You write `$\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$`
  - You get $\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$
- Display style should be enclosed into double dollar signs:
  - You write 
  ```
  $$\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$$
  ```
  
  - You get $$\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$$

# R code

- This is the best advantage to write your documents in R Markdown: Your report is directly connected to your data analysis!

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
summary(x)
```
````

### Output:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
summary(x)
```

---
.pull-left[

### Input: 

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x,y)
```
````
]
.pull-right[

### Output:

```{r}
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x,y)
```
]

---
# Tables

You can use the kable and kableExtra packages for tables:

.pull-left[

### Input: 

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
dt %>%
  kable()
```
````
]
.pull-right[

### Output:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
dt %>%
  kable()
```
]

---
# Maps

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo = F}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(16.933685, 52.408137, zoom = 17)
```
````

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(16.933685, 52.408137, zoom = 17)
```

## Advantages of HTML solutions (html, ioslides, slidy)

### Interactive plots

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(widgetframe)
x <- seq(-3,3,0.01)
y <- x^2
data <- tibble(x, y)
l <- plot_ly(data=data, x=~x, y=~y)
frameWidget(l, width='100%', height='80%')
```
