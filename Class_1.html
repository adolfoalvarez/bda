# Who are you?

---
# What will be we doing together the next weeks?

--
Mostly learn together!
--

- Propositions, logical connectives, truth tables, and tautologies.
- Inference, checking the deductibility of requested and reliability schemes
- Predicate calculus
- Validation requested in the predicate calculus using Venn diagrams
- Set theory: definitions, acting on sets, the power set, the Cartesian product
- Binary relations: ways to write binary relations (among others matrices and graphs), actions, properties of relationships

---
#All of this will lead us to probabilities! (the second part of this Discrete Mathematics course)

---
# Evaluation

- One test at the end of the logic module. (19/12)
- One test at the end of the probability module. (06/02)
- A replacement test (logic + probability) at the end of two modules. (13/02)

#Let's start

# Propositions

The basic concept of propositional logic is the proposition. A proposition is a sentence that
can be assigned a truth value: true or false .
Some simple examples are:


- The Sun is hot.
- The Earth is made of cheese.
- 3 plus 3 equals 33.
- The 999-th decimal digit of the number π is 9.

---
# Propositions
Here are some sentences that are not propositions (why?):

- Are you bored?
- Please, don’t go away!
- x is an integer.
- This sentence is false.

---
# Propositional logical connectives
The propositions above are very simple. They have no logical structure, so we call them primi-
tive propositions. From primitive propositions one can form compound ones by using logical
connectives. The most commonly used connectives are:

- not, called negation, denoted by `\(\neg\)`
- and, called conjunction, denoted by `\(\wedge\)` (or sometimes, by `\(\&amp;\)`)
- or, called disjunction, denoted by `\(\lor\)`
- if...then..., called implication, or conditional, denoted by `\(\to\)`
- ... if and only if ... , called biconditional, denoted by `\(\leftrightarrow\)`

---
# Propositional logical connectives

The proposition `\(A \to B\)` means: If `\(A\)` is true, then `\(B\)` must be true.

When this proposition is true? When is false?

--

"If you eat your vegetables, I will give you ice cream"

---
# Propositional logical connectives

Other ways to "read" `\(A \to B\)`

- A implies B
- If A (then) B.
- A only if B.
- B if A.
- B whenever A.
- A is sufficient for B. (Meaning: the truth of A is sufficient for the truth of B.)
- B is necessary for A. (Meaning: the truth of B is necessary for A to be true.)
---
## Truth tables
How about the truth value of a compound proposition? It can be calculated from the truth
values of the components (in much the same way as we can calculate the value of the algebraic
expression `\(A × (B − C) + B∕A\)` as soon as we know the values of `\(A\)`‚ `\(B\)`‚ `\(C\)`) by following the rules
of “propositional arithmetic”:

- The proposition `\(\neg A\)` is true if and only if the proposition `\(A\)` is false.
- The proposition `\(A \wedge B\)` is true if and only if both `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are true.
- The proposition `\(A \lor B\)` is true if and only if either of `\(A\)` or `\(B\)` (possibly both) is true.
- The proposition `\(A \to B\)` is true if and only if `\(A\)` is false or `\(B\)` is true, i.e. if the truth of `\(A\)` implies the truth of `\(B\)`.
- The proposition `\(A \leftrightarrow B\)` is true if and only if A and B have the same truth values.

---
## Truth tables

- We can systematize these rules in kinds of “multiplication tables”. 
- We denote the value true by T and the value false by F. 
- Another common notation, particularly used in computer science, is to denote true by 1 and false by 0.

| `\(p\)` | `\(\neg p\)` |
|---|---|
|T|F|
|F|T|

.

| `\(p\)` | `\(q\)` | `\(p \wedge q\)` | `\(p \lor q\)` | `\(p \to q\)` | `\(p \leftrightarrow q\)`|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T | T | T | T | T | T|
| T | F | F | T | F | F|
| F | T | F | T | T | F|
| F | F | F | F | T | T|

# Example

Let's say `\(p\)` is "0.5 is an integer", q is "2 is less than 3", and r is "The Moon is larger than the Sun”, let's evaluate the following proposition:

`\((p \lor \neg (q \wedge  \neg r)) \to  \neg \neg r\)`

How do we start?

--

`\((F \lor \neg (T \wedge  \neg F)) \to  \neg \neg F\)`


--

`\((F \lor \neg (T \wedge  T)) \to  \neg T\)` =

--

`\((F \lor \neg T) \to  F\)` = 

--

`\((F \lor F) \to  F\)` = 

--

`\(F \to  F\)` = 

--

`\(T\)`.

---
# Example
We can use the truth tables to evaluate every possible case for p, q, r:

| `\(p\)` | `\(q\)` | `\(r\)` | `\(\neg r\)` | `\(\neg \neg r\)` | `\(q \wedge \neg r\)` | `\(\neg(q \wedge \neg r)\)` | `\(p \lor \neg(q \wedge \neg r)\)` | `\((p \lor \neg(q \wedge \neg r)) \to \neg \neg r\)` |

## Let's practise

If `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are true propositions and `\(C\)` and `\(D\)` are false ones, determine the truth values of the following compound propositions:

a) `\(A \wedge (\neg B \lor C)\)`

b) `\(\neg ( \neg A \lor D) \to \neg B\)`

c) `\(\neg (\neg D \wedge (B \to \neg A)\)`

d) `\((C \to A) \to D\)`

e) `\(C \to (A \to D)\)`

f) `\(\neg (C \to A) \lor (C \to D)\)`

g) `\((A \to \neg A) \lor (C \leftrightarrow \neg B )\)`

---
## Let's practise 
Write each of the following composite propositions in a symbolic form by identifying its atomic propositions and logical structure. Then determine its truth value.

a) The Sun is hot and if the Earth is larger than Jupiter then there is life on Jupiter.

b) If the Sun rotates around the Earth or the Earth rotates around the Moon then the Sun rotates around the Moon.

c) The Moon does not rotate around the Earth if the Sun does not rotates around the Earth and the Earth does not rotate around the Moon.

d) The Earth rotate around itself only if the Sun rotates around the Earth or the Moon does not rotate around the Earth.

e) The Earth rotates around itself if and only if the Sun does not rotate around itself or the Moon does not rotate around itself.

---
## Let's practise 
Determine the truth value of the proposition A in each of the following cases:

a) `\(B\)` and `\(B \to A\)` are true.

b) `\(A \to B\)` is true and `\(B\)` is false

c) `\(\neg B\)` and `\(A \lor B\)` are true.

d) Each of `\(B \to  \neg A\)`, `\(\neg B \to  \neg C\)` and `\(C\)` is true.

e) Each of `\(\neg C \wedge  B\)`, `\(C \to  (A \lor B)\)`, and `\(\neg (A \lor C) \to  C\)` is true.
(Hint: consider cases for the truth of `\(B\)` and `\(C\)`.)
